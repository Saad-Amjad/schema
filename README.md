# angular-schema

This repository is a basic Schematic implementation that serves as a starting point to create and publish Schematics to NPM.

### Testing

To test locally, install `@angular-devkit/schematics-cli` globally and use the `schematics` command line tool. That tool acts the same as the `generate` command of the Angular CLI, but also has a debug mode.

Check the documentation with

```bash
schematics --help
```

That's it!

### Installing the package

Go to your angular project and after installing the package run:

```bash
npm i angular-schema
```

### Running the schema

Go to your angular project and after installing the package run:

```bash
ng g angular-schema:core
ng g angular-schema:token
```

That's it!
